# cheatsheets
This repo contains all the problems, their solutions and knowledgable stuff I have encountered on my way through life. The information is classified using subdirectories for the overall area and underlying files for the explicit topic of interest. Problems, solutions and interesting stuff are all contained within the same files.\\\
